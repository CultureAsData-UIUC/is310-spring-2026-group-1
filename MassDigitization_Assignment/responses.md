### **Discovering & Digitizing Cultural Objects**

3. In the context of African American literature and the early 20th century, historical equivalents to digital objects like social media included magazines, newspapers, journals, and letter writing. This acted as sites of communication, exchange of opinion, and records of daily life between people and communities, similar to how the media functions today. 

However, these historical objects were physical and limited, making it hard to share and access, making it different from the efficiency and accessibility we see from social media. Our chosen poems were shared through printed magazines, acting as early forms of activism with similar functions as activism on social platforms. In some sense, they both share the ability to spread news and reach the public audience; however, the digital counterpart is just way more efficient.

4. The social media posts we see so commonly nowadays are clear forms of born-digital materials. Things like Instagram posts or stories are things that only exist digitally, and never (or at least not yet) exist in a physical form, as they can’t physically appear in front of us outside of the digital platform. This is different from digitized materials like the photo scans of our chosen poems. This is because our poems existed physically first, as printed objects, and were later scanned into digital archives like HathiTrust. If HathiTrust were to suddenly crash and disappear, our chosen poems would not be as affected; it wouldn’t disappear along with the platform like Instagram stories would. 

When we compare the two, born-digital content is able to constantly change. It is unstable as it can be updated easily, but also lost easily (deleted platform, etc.). However, digitized materials have the ability to be preserved in the long term, as they cannot be lost as easily when the original copy stays secure.
