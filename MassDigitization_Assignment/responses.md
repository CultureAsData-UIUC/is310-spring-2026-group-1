### **Discovering & Digitizing Cultural Objects**
1. Digital products within our area of focus would include athletes' online posts. These could be to sites like Instagram, TikTok, X (Twitter), etc. Additional digital products could include highlight reels of athletes, and online comments made by fans regarding an athlete and their performance. These digital products are important because they shape how an athlete is publicly interpreted. They can affect the culture of their team, fans, brand sponsorships, and even the sport in general by the semantics that their presence has online. The more publicly available an athlete or team is online, the more interaction and communication they're going to have with their fans. These digital products wrap our themes of sports, social media, and cultural influence all together. 

2. In our area of focus, digital products are often already born digital. An athlete or team's social media presence is built directly on platforms that create digital posts. For example, athletes/teams often have social media managers who gather clips, videos, or pictures of the athlete, and then create captions and post to a social media site. From there, highlight clips and fan edits can be made from the athlete’s original content. Sports media outlets like ESPN or FOX can also create products, by streaming the games for fans, These media outlets also grab media from the stream, edit them into clips, and then post them as highlights to their own social media, further stretching the audience that interacts with this athlete/team. This process still produces digital first products. With the growing popularity of social media apps, so many of them allow for in-app editing, which can automatically generate subtitles, has image recognition, offers the media managers analytics into their posts, and boosts specific content given it’s success in the algorithm. In HathiTrust, physical books and newspapers are scanned and turned into images. Those images are then run through OCR to extract the text from the images. There can be mistakes due to different fonts or text styles. The entire process converts physical materials into digital materials. Social media posts are very different. They start digital, they automatically include metadata like date of creation, they’re immediately interactive, and the content continues to get pushed through fan interactions, remixes, and comments. 

3. In the context of African American literature and the early 20th century, historical equivalents to digital objects like social media included magazines, newspapers, journals, and letter writing. This acted as sites of communication, exchange of opinion, and records of daily life between people and communities, similar to how the media functions today. However, these historical objects were physical and limited, making it hard to share and access, making it different from the efficiency and accessibility we see from social media. Our chosen poems were shared through printed magazines, acting as early forms of activism with similar functions as activism on social platforms. In some sense, they both share the ability to spread news and reach the public audience; however, the digital counterpart is just way more efficient.

4. The social media posts we see so commonly nowadays are clear forms of born-digital materials. Things like Instagram posts or stories are things that only exist digitally, and never (or at least not yet) exist in a physical form, as they can’t physically appear in front of us outside of the digital platform. This is different from digitized materials like the photo scans of our chosen poems. This is because our poems existed physically first, as printed objects, and were later scanned into digital archives like HathiTrust. If HathiTrust were to suddenly crash and disappear, our chosen poems would not be as affected; it wouldn’t disappear along with the platform like Instagram stories would. When we compare the two, born-digital content is able to constantly change. It is unstable as it can be updated easily, but also lost easily (deleted platform, etc.). However, digitized materials have the ability to be preserved in the long term, as they cannot be lost as easily when the original copy stays secure.
