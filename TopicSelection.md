# IS 310 Topic Selection

## Group Theme: Sports, Social Media, and Cultural Influence

Our area of interest falls within the intersection of sports culture and digital media, particularly how online platforms create meaning, identity, power, and engagement in sports. There is an entire cultural system that drives sports, much of which is visible through social media, news coverage, fan communities, branding, and other digital spaces.

### Cultural Objects, Practices, and Phenomena
- Athlete and team social media accounts  
- Sports media narratives and viral moments  
- Fan discussions, memes, and online communities  
- Public reactions to controversy, activism, or major cultural events  
- Media outreach and branding across multiple social platforms  

### Included Within Scope
- Media-facing sports culture  
- Public digital content and interactions  
- Interpretive analysis of how social media and community dynamics affect athletes  

### Beyond the Scope
- Historical sports culture without a digital or media component  
- Sports analysis focused purely on performance statistics  
- Media unrelated to sports or athletes

## Individual Ideas

### Maya
A specific dataset I am considering would examine how different NFL players’ online involvement affects their performance on the field. This would include how frequently players engage with online content and the type of engagement. This topic relates to the group theme by exploring how social media presence can influence an athlete’s career, livelihood, and performance. I chose this topic because online discourse has, in some cases, led to players being removed from the field, and I want to better understand how different forms of online engagement may positively or negatively impact performance, branding, and career outcomes.

### Adam
I am interested in the storytelling side of sports and whether sports narratives meaningfully influence how games are perceived and understood. Narratives are created by analysts, fans, teams, and athletes themselves, and social media amplifies these stories by making them widely visible. While I have not identified a specific dataset yet, an ideal dataset would include written or spoken sports coverage paired with descriptive metadata—such as source type, time period, subject, and narrative theme—to examine how narratives shape perception, meaning, and engagement within sports culture.

### Tiffany
The dataset I am interested in using would include volleyball players’ performance data (represented by average points scored) alongside measures of their Instagram activity and popularity, such as number of posts, followers, and comments. This topic relates to the group theme by exploring the relationship between social media activity and athletic performance. I am interested in this topic because, as concerns about media usage continue to grow, understanding how social media engagement correlates with professional athletes’ performance is a relevant and timely question.

### Colin
The data I plan to work with includes datasets covering tennis players’ (ATP/WTA) social media activity and their subsequent match performances. The datasets include 124,341 tweets scraped from 31 tennis players, along with 8,095 match performances following those posts. This aligns with the group theme by focusing on sports through the lens of social media. Tennis is both physically and mentally demanding, and players’ social media presence may offer insight into their mental state before matches, which could correlate with performance. In the future, I would also be interested in exploring additional social media platforms beyond Twitter.

### Alex
My dataset focuses on MLB Player Digital Engagement Forecasting, examining how team social media activity affects overall fan engagement. This directly aligns with our group theme by exploring how online platforms create meaning and influence in sports. Using variables such as number of followers, following count, total tweets, and tweets in the last month, this dataset allows for deeper analysis of how social media activity impacts fan connectivity. I chose this topic as a starting point for creating a more personalized dataset, beginning with team accounts before expanding to individual player accounts for a more holistic view.

### Ray
My dataset focuses on the relationship between NBA players’ online popularity and their salaries. Specifically, I would compare social media follower counts with player earnings. This topic fits well within our group theme because social media plays a major role in shaping modern sports culture, influence, and public perception. A player’s popularity reflects not only athletic performance but also cultural relevance and media visibility. This project explores whether digital presence translates into economic value in professional sports.

## Collaboration Plan

Our group plans to hold weekly updates to share progress, discuss how individual findings relate to the overall theme, and identify results worth further exploration.  

When working on GitHub, each group member has their own branch. Any updates to the repository will be submitted through pull requests, allowing for peer review before merging into the main branch. We also plan to create individual folders for dataset work to keep the repository organized and ensure smooth collaboration.
