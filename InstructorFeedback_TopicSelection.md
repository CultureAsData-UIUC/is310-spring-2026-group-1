# Instructor Feedback on Group & Individual Topic Selection

## Group Feedback

Overall, this is a strong and timely group theme that fits very well with the goals of the course. Your focus on sports culture as mediated through digital platforms (social media, news coverage, fan communities, branding, etc.) is clear, contemporary, and appropriately scoped around cultural objects and practices rather than just performance statistics. I especially appreciate the way you distinguished between what is in scope (media-facing sports culture, public digital interactions, interpretive analysis) and what is out of scope (purely statistical performance analysis or non-digital sports history). That shows thoughtful alignment with the course emphasis on culture, meaning, and data.

That said, there are a few areas where your framing could become more conceptually precise and more grounded in LIS and scholarly approaches.

1. **Clarify the Core Analytical Question**

Right now, the theme identifies many interesting phenomena (fans, narratives, branding, engagement), but the central analytical question is still somewhat diffuse. You repeatedly gesture toward “influence,” but it is not yet clear what you mean exactly by influence, and how you will operationalize it in your analysis. You might consider how you would answer these questions in your framing and datasets:

- Influence implies direction, but what direction are you look at exactly? Is it all directions, or fans influencing athletes, or athletes influencing fans, platforms influencing both, or something else?
- Also it might be worth considering influence in what form? Do you mean influence in terms of shaping perceptions, economic value, reputation, performance, or visibility?
- Finally, influence at what scale? Is it at the level of individual interactions or careers or teams, broader cultural narratives, economic markets or platforms, or something else?

Obviously these are massive questions, but I think approaching "influence" thoughtfully and critically will help you over the course of the semester. Especially, since trying to datafy influence can be very subjective.

2. **Engage with the Political Economy of Platforms & Sports**

A key conceptual risk in this topic is treating social media and fan engagement as neutral cultural spaces. From an Information Sciences perspective, platforms are not just passive venues—they are infrastructures with:

- Algorithms that shape visibility
- Ownership and monetization structures
- Content moderation policies
- Data extraction and engagement incentives

In other words, sports culture on digital platforms is not only about fandom and interaction, but also about who controls the platforms, who benefits economically, and how visibility is structured. Incorporating even a light awareness of platform power (rather than only user behavior) will significantly strengthen your work.

3. **Engage with Published Scholarship**

This topic sits at the intersection of sports studies, media studies, computational social science, and information science, so there is a rich body of scholarship you can draw on to ground your analysis. I would encourage you to start engaging with some of the key works in these fields early on, especially those that critically analyze sports media, fandom, and digital culture. This will help you develop a more nuanced understanding of the phenomena you are studying and also provide theoretical frameworks for your analysis.

Highly recommend taking a look at the following works as a starting point:

- Walsh, Melanie. “The Challenges and Possibilities of Social Media Data: New Directions in Literary Studies and the Digital Humanities.” In* Debates in the Digital Humanities 2023*, edited by Matthew K. Gold and Lauren F. Klein. University of Minnesota Press, 2023. JSTOR. [http://www.jstor.org.proxy2.library.illinois.edu/stable/10.5749/j.ctv345pd4p.21](http://www.jstor.org.proxy2.library.illinois.edu/stable/10.5749/j.ctv345pd4p.21).
- Coombs, Danielle Sarver, and Anne C. Osborne. *Routledge Handbook of Sport Fans and Fandom*. Routledge International Handbooks. Routledge, 2022. (Available in print and ebook through the library)

But generally you should look for materials in journals like *Communication & Sport*, *Journal of Sport & Social Issues*, *New Media & Society*, *Big Data & Society*, and *Social Media + Society*.

Given your topic, you might also consider (optionally) reaching out to Prof. Madeleine Sanfilippo in the iSchool, whose work on broadcasting regulations and media infrastructures (e.g., NFL blackout policies) touches directly on how information access and platform governance shape sports culture. This would help you think about sports not just as fandom, but as an information and policy ecosystem.

I like your collaboration plan of weekly updates and using GitHub branches and pull requests for peer review, as well as individual folders for each person's dataset. You might also consider setting up a running GitHub issue to share thoughts about overall principles for this type of data collection, but that is just a suggestion. Overall, think this is a good foundation and excited to see what you all create!

### Maya

Your focus on NFL players' online engagement and its relationship to athletic performance and career outcomes is a compelling starting point. The core question—whether online presence affects an athlete's success on and off the field—touches on important issues about digital reputation, branding, and the intersection of athletic and social media performance. However, this topic needs significant narrowing and conceptual clarity to become a feasible research project.

The biggest challenge here is scope. "Online involvement," "performance," and "career outcomes" are each massive topics that could encompass countless variables. You'll need to make strategic decisions about:

- Which platforms matter? Are you looking at Twitter/X, Instagram, TikTok, Reddit discussions about players, or news coverage of their online activity? Each platform has different affordances, audiences, and norms that would shape your analysis differently.
- What counts as online engagement? Posting frequency? Content type? Follower counts? Controversies? You need to operationalize this concept into something you can actually measure with available data.
- What kind of impact are you examining? Career longevity? Salary? Playing time? Brand deals? Team roster decisions? Public perception? Each of these would require different data sources and analytical approaches.

At its core then, you need to answer where will this data come from, and how accessible and feasible is it to collect the data you envision. You might try to answer the following questions to help you narrow down your focus:

- Will you manually collect data or use web scraping? Do the platforms you are interested in have restrictions on what data you can access?
- Are you starting with players who were publicly "canceled" or penalized for online behavior, or attempting a broader sample of NFL players? How might you turn complex narratives of controversial online behavior into data exactly? Will it be something about the negativity of coverage or virality or something else?
- What's your unit of analysis—individual posts, players over time, specific incidents?

If you focus on high-profile cases where online behavior led to consequences, be aware of potential tautology: studying only players whose careers were damaged by online activity won't tell you much about the general relationship between online presence and performance. It might be more interesting to examine variation—why do some controversies end careers while others don't? What makes certain online behavior "career-threatening" versus merely controversial? Or you might look at whether players are become more homogenized in their posting to avoid potential backlash, and how that affects their engagement and brand.

Which of course raises broader questions about the relationship between online presence and career outcomes, and what confounds might exist. For instance, the same post might be career-ending for a backup player but barely noticed for a star. Team culture, position, contract status, and timing all matter. Also consider causality: does controversial online behavior cause poor performance, or do struggling players make poor online decisions? Are both driven by other factors? All big questions.

Which is why I think as a first step, I would highly suggest you look at existing research on athlete social media use, online reputation management, and "cancel culture" in sports contexts. This scholarship will help you understand what's already known and where gaps exist. Once you have that grounding, then you can start to narrow your focus to specific platforms, players or teams, and types of online engagement that are most relevant to your research question. The key is to move from the broad question "Does online engagement affect NFL careers?" to something more specific and answerable with the time and resources you have. What specific aspect of this relationship can you actually examine with data, and what would that data look like? Happy to chat more if you have questions about how to narrow this down!

Your interest in sports narratives and how storytelling shapes perception and engagement is an excellent fit for this course, and it aligns well with broader questions about how media creates meaning. The idea of pairing written or spoken sports coverage with descriptive metadata (source type, time period, subject, narrative theme) shows you're thinking systematically about how to approach this. However, the scope here is extremely broad and needs significant narrowing to become a feasible project.The core challenge is that "how narratives shape perception, meaning, and engagement within sports culture" is a question that could occupy multiple researchers over entire careers. To make this work, you'll need to make some hard choices about what specific aspect of sports narrative you're actually examining.

A fundamental question: what do you mean by a narrative in sports coverage? Are you looking at:

- Narrative arcs (underdog stories, redemption tales, rivalry narratives)?
- Framing devices (how the same event gets told differently by different outlets)?
- Recurring tropes or storylines that get applied to athletes or teams?
- The relationship between pre-game narratives and post-game interpretation?

In computational literary studies, researchers have developed methods for modeling narrative patterns and story structures. You might explore whether similar approaches could work for sports coverage—for instance, analyzing whether certain narrative templates (comeback stories, dynasty narratives, individual vs. team emphasis) appear consistently across coverage of different events.

But your bigger issue is that right now you're at about 30,000 feet. To make this concrete, consider:

- Which sport exactly? Different sports have different narrative cultures. Basketball narratives emphasize individual players differently than football narratives do.
- Which platforms and formats are you planning to focus on? Are you analyzing written journalism, broadcast commentary, social media reactions, or some combination? Video coverage would add an entirely different layer of complexity. Generally, I would highly suggest looking at restrictions on accessing material as well.
- What time frame will you explore? A single season? A specific event or moment? Coverage of a particular team or player over time?
- What makes a narrative "meaningful"? Is virality your measure of impact? Fan engagement metrics? How the narrative persists over time?

You angle you might consider is examining how a particular sports moment gets narrated across different platforms—traditional sports journalism, Twitter/X reactions, Reddit discussions, TikTok commentary—and analyze how the narrative evolves or fragments across these spaces. This would let you examine both narrative construction and amplification while keeping your scope manageable. Or you might focus on a specific type of narrative (e.g., "underdog" stories or redemption arcs) and analyze how that narrative gets applied to different teams or players over time.

To help you do this though, I think you need to also spend some time clarifying what you mean by "narrative theme" and "subject" as metadata categories. How many themes exist potentially? How will you identify them in the data? Will you use manual coding, or some kind of automated topic modeling? How will you validate that your themes are meaningful and not just noise?

Before committing to your approach, you might also look at existing work on sports media narratives, as well as data storytelling generally. Understanding what's already known will help you identify a specific gap or angle that's both original and feasible, and also help you think about how you might turn broader narratives into something tractable with data.

Your focus on volleyball is refreshing—I've never had a student examine this sport, and it tends to receive far less scholarly and media attention than football, basketball, or baseball, which makes it an interesting choice. I also appreciate that you've identified a specific platform (Instagram) rather than trying to examine "social media" broadly. However, there are several practical and conceptual issues you'll need to address to make this project feasible.

First, the basic scope questions:

- How many players? Are you looking at a specific league (college, professional, international)?
- Which teams or level of play? The relationship between social media and performance might look very different for Olympic athletes versus college players versus professional league players.
- Geographic scope? I'm assuming you mean American volleyball, but there are significant international professional leagues. Nationality and league differences could matter a lot here.

Performance data for volleyball is likely available through official league statistics, but you'll need to verify the quality and completeness of this data. More critically, Instagram poses significant data collection challenges as it does not allow general scraping of content. You'll need to collect data manually or use very limited API access, which means your sample size will necessarily be small. Also how far back will you go? Instagram launched in 2010 so you have some potential to look longer but Instagram activity can fluctuate a lot over time, so you might want to consider how to capture that temporal dimension.

I did like your focus on posts, comments, and followers, but you might want to consider how you turn those into data. For instance, will you copy the full post or just count the number of posts? Will you analyze the content of the posts (e.g., sentiment, themes) or just look at engagement metrics? How will you handle the fact that some players might have private accounts or varying levels of activity?

Beyond data logistics, there's a more fundamental issue: what relationship do you expect to find, and why would it be interesting? The most obvious hypothesis—that better players have more Instagram followers—seems almost tautological. Of course successful athletes tend to be more popular. So what's the deeper question you're trying to answer? Are you interested in whether social media activity predicts performance (i.e., does time spent on Instagram correlate with athletic outcomes)? Are you examining whether certain types of social media engagement correlate with performance differently (e.g., does posting workout content vs. lifestyle content matter)? Are you interested in the economics and branding side—whether social media presence affects sponsorship opportunities or career longevity independent of performance? The relationship between "popularity and performance" could run in multiple directions. Popular players might post more because they have larger audiences and brand obligations. Alternatively, players who invest heavily in social media might have less time for training. Or there might be no relationship at all, with social media use driven entirely by personal preference and marketing strategy rather than athletic success. So I would recommend starting to think about what exactly you are trying to capture with this dataset. You might for instance end up being more interested in the aesthetics of volleyball players' Instagram content and how that contributes to their personal brand, rather than trying to correlate it with performance. Or you could look at Instagram as a community platform for volleyball fans and players, and try to capture how players and fans interact around volleyball content. There are many interesting angles here, but you need to clarify what specific relationship you're trying to examine and why it matters.

Generally, I would recommend you start by looking at existing research on athlete social media use and potentially looking at research on the economics of volleyball to help you refine your question. Happy to chat more if you have questions about how to narrow this down!

I appreciate that you've already identified specific datasets—this shows you're thinking concretely about data availability, which is excellent. The combination of 124,341 tweets from 31 tennis players alongside 8,095 match performances gives you substantial material to work with. However, before committing to these datasets, you need to do significant verification and think carefully about what you're actually trying to examine.

Since this course allows you to either create data from scratch or augment existing datasets, your first step should be thoroughly understanding and documenting what you're working with. I would have appreciated links to these datasets in your proposal, so please share those. Key questions to investigate:

- Who collected this data and how? What was their methodology? What was included and excluded?
- Are these tweets by the tennis players themselves, or tweets about them by fans, media, or other accounts? This fundamentally changes what you can analyze.
- How evenly are the 124,341 tweets distributed across the 31 players? Is one player responsible for 100,000 tweets while others have only a handful? Or are these tweets just by random users? Do the tweets then relate to all players equally or are they unevenly distributed? Massive imbalances would limit what claims you can make
- What metadata was captured? Do you have timestamps, retweet counts, likes, replies? Or just tweet text?
- How many of these tweets still exist? Twitter/X accounts get deleted, tweets get removed, and platforms change. You could augment this dataset by checking which tweets are still accessible.
- Also where does this match performance data come from? What does it include—win/loss records, rankings, specific match statistics? How does it align temporally with the tweet data?

Beyond data logistics, what relationship are you actually trying to examine? You mention "social media presence may offer insight into their mental state before matches, which could correlate with performance," but this needs much more specificity. Do players who tweet more frequently before matches perform worse (distraction hypothesis)? Does the sentiment of pre-match tweets correlate with performance outcomes? Do players become more active on social media after losses versus wins (emotional processing)? Does social media attention (being discussed online) correlate with match performance? Each of these would require different analytical approaches and might tell you very different things about the relationship between social media and athletic performance.

You note that tennis is both physically and mentally demanding, which is true, but you need to think about what makes tennis distinctive for this kind of analysis. Do tennis players manage their own brands and social media entirely, since here's no team communications department filtering their posts? Tennis has a unique competitive calendar with different surfaces, tournament levels, and travel demands. Does timing within a season or tournament matter? Are these 31 players evenly distributed across gender, nationality, ranking level? These factors could significantly influence both social media use and the relationship to performance. Are all tweets in English, or are they in multiple languages reflecting players' nationalities? If multilingual, how will you handle translation and sentiment analysis?

Understanding the context of this data matters. Twitter's role in sports culture has changed dramatically over the past decade. Data from 2012 looks very different from 2022. Furthermore, Twitter has undergone significant changes (algorithmic timeline, character limits, ownership changes). When was this data collected relative to these shifts? You mention interest in expanding to other platforms beyond Twitter. That's interesting, but I worry starting with multiple platforms would add enormous complexity, so would encourage you to start with one first.

At its core though, if you use these existing datasets, think about how you could meaningfully augment them. You could do a verification study to see how many of the original tweets still exist, what patterns exist in missing data, and whether that introduces bias. You could also add data from additional players to test whether any patterns you find hold more broadly. You could collect richer metadata about the players (rankings over time, career stage, nationality) to contextualize the social media activity. You might also want to get at what is in the tweets themselves, so considering various text analysis approaches (named entities, topic modeling) could be interesting. These are just potential suggestions though.

I would highly recommend as a next/first step starting with studying these datasets themselves. Where do they come from and who collected them are core questions you need to answer at the outset before you can really start to figure out how to augment them. There's also substantial scholarship on Twitter communities, so you might also start to look at this to help you think about how to analyze the social media data.

### Alex

Your focus on MLB and the relationship between team social media activity and fan engagement is a solid starting point, but I need significant clarification about what you're actually proposing. Right now, there's confusion about whether "MLB Player Digital Engagement Forecasting" is an existing dataset you've found, a platform you plan to scrape, or simply your project title.

I appreciate that you've identified specific variables (follower counts, following counts, total tweets, tweets in the last month), which suggests you're thinking about Twitter/X data. However, several fundamental questions need answers:

- Are you examining team accounts, individual player accounts, or both? You mention starting with teams before expanding to players, but this needs a clearer rationale. What would you learn from team accounts that justifies starting there? Also how many teams? How many players? Over what time period? MLB has 30 teams and hundreds of players—you need to narrow this considerably.
- Have you verified you can actually collect this data? Twitter has significantly restricted data access, especially since 2023. Python libraries for scraping exist but may not work reliably anymore. You might need to look at historical Twitter datasets instead of real-time collection.

Your core interest seems to be fan connectivity, but this concept needs much more precision. What do you mean by connectivity, and how would you measure it? Are you examining how players engage with fans (replies, quote tweets, direct interaction)? Are you analyzing how fans react to players' tweets (likes, retweets, replies)? Are you looking at whether certain social media strategies correlate with broader fan engagement metrics (attendance, merchandise sales, TV ratings)?

Right now, your variables (follower counts, tweet frequency) seem to focus on player/team activity, but it's unclear how this connects to fan behavior. If your hypothesis is simply that popular players have more followers, that's fairly obvious and not particularly interesting. The deeper analysis you mention needs to be articulated: what specific relationship are you testing?

To make this more compelling, you might explore:

- Do certain types of content (game updates vs. personal posts vs. fan interactions) generate different levels of fan engagement? Do some teams or players have distinctive social media approaches that create closer fan relationships?
- How does social media activity correlate with team performance? Do fans engage more during winning streaks? Do players tweet differently during slumps?
- Rather than just measuring follower counts, could you analyze fan discussions (perhaps on Reddit or team forums) to understand how social media activity shapes fan community dynamics? I've had students successfully scrape Reddit game threads to analyze how fans react to specific player performances during games so that might be one angle to explore.
- How do different teams approach fan engagement on social media, and what can we learn from variation in strategy and outcomes?

You mention "forecasting" in your title, but it's unclear what you mean. Are you building data for a predictive model for future fan engagement based on social media metrics? Forecasting which social media strategies will be most effective? Simply analyzing historical patterns to identify trends? If you're genuinely interested in prediction, be aware this adds significant methodological complexity. You'd need to account for numerous confounding variables (team success, player trades, league-wide trends, platform changes) and have sufficient temporal data to train and test models. This might be overly ambitious for this course.

I think your focus on digital engagement is interesting though so you might want to consider what you mean by digital engagement exactly. Part of this is really narrowing your focus and clarifying your scope and terms. What time period will you examine? Suggest trying to be realistic about what's feasible to collect. Also which teams/players and why? Are you doing a random sample? Top performers? Specific divisions? Finally, how will you get this data if it doesn't already exist? If does exist, how are you planning to augment and verify it? 

I would highly recommend you start by clarifying these questions before you commit to a specific dataset or analytical approach. You might also look at some of the existing data on baseball analytics. It is the sport that coined Moneyball right, so there's lots of research there that might help you start to clarify and narrow.

### Ray

Your focus on the relationship between NBA players' online popularity and salaries is a timely question that touches on important issues about athlete branding, economic value, and the role of social media in professional sports. However, there's a significant risk of tautology here that you need to address head-on to make this project meaningful.

The most obvious pattern—that highly paid superstars like LeBron James also have massive social media followings—isn't particularly revealing. Power and popularity tend to reinforce each other: successful athletes get paid more, receive more media attention, attract more fans, and consequently have larger social media audiences. So if your analysis simply confirms that top-earning players have the most followers, what have we actually learned?

To make this interesting, you need to identify and examine variation or exceptions to this pattern:

- Are there players with relatively modest salaries but outsized social media presence? What explains this gap
- Are there players whose social media growth preceded salary increases, suggesting that digital presence might influence contract negotiations?
- Do certain types of social media engagement (authentic personal content vs. promotional posts) correlate differently with earnings?
- How does social media presence relate to salary relative to on-court performance? That is, do players who are active on social media earn more than similarly skilled players who aren't?

"Social media follower counts" is not a bad starting point, but it needs significant refinement:

- Which platforms? Instagram, Twitter/X, TikTok, YouTube? Each platform has different demographics, engagement patterns, and importance in athlete branding. A player might be huge on TikTok but relatively unknown on Twitter.
- Just followers, or engagement? Follower counts can be inflated by bots and inactive accounts. Engagement metrics (likes, comments, shares) might better capture actual influence, though these are harder to collect at scale. Also are you looking at current follower counts, or trying to track growth over time? The latter would be much more informative but also harder to obtain.

NBA salary data is publicly available, which is helpful, but you need to think carefully about what "salary" means in this context. Many NBA players earn more from endorsements and brand deals than from their team contracts. If you're interested in whether social media presence translates to economic value, is salary the right measure? At the same time, endorsement data is much harder to find and verify, so you might need to focus on team salary while acknowledging this limitation. You also need to consider how to account for confounding factors that influence salary independent of social media presence: like career stage, team market size, position, and on-court performance. One alternative angle might be rather than looking at this relationship between salary and social media activity, you look at online discourses around NBA salaries. For instance, you could analyze Reddit discussions or Twitter reactions to major contract signings to understand how fans perceive the relationship between performance, popularity, and pay. This would allow you to examine the cultural meaning of NBA salaries in relation to social media presence without getting bogged down in the complexities of causality and confounding variables. Alternatively, you might focus on a specific case study of a player whose social media presence seems disproportionate to their salary (either much higher or much lower) and analyze what explains this outlier. This would allow you to explore the nuances of how digital presence interacts with economic value in a more focused way. Or you could even consider looking at players with limited to no social media presence and analyze how that affects their public perception and marketability compared to similar players with active online profiles. 

Lots of interesting angles here, so the next steps should be concretizing and narrowing your focus. You might look into research on the economics of NBA salaries, as well as research on which platforms are most important for athlete branding. You also need to again think carefully about data collection and how you will handle restrictions. Finally, how will you verify salary data and its quality? All core things to confront and happy to chat more if you have questions about how to narrow this down!
